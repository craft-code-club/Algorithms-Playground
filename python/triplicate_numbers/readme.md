## Triplicate Number Validation

The purpose of this algorithm is to determine whether a given string representation of a positive integer qualifies as a triplicate number. A triplicate number is defined as a number that can be entirely reduced to an empty string by sequentially removing all instances of three consecutive identical digits.

#### Input Specification:

- The algorithm must accept a string representation of a positive integer.
- The string should only contain numeric characters (0-9).

#### The algorithm must return a boolean value.
- Return true if the string can be completely reduced to an empty string (indicating it is a triplicate number).
- Return false if any digits remain in the string after all possible triplet removals (indicating it is not a triplicate number).
